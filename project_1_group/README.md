*Worldwide Causes of Death

*Worldwide Disease Analysis (1990-2015)
-The top 2 deaths worldwide are caused by Cardiovascular Diseases and Neoplasms (Malignant Cancer/Tumor) which have gradually increased over this time period.
-Cardiovascular diseases and Neoplasms caused nearly half of the deaths worldwide during this timeline.
-Total amount of deaths increases over this time period which may coincide with the total population increase worldwide.

*Top 5 Diseases Analysis
-The discrepancy between the top ranked cause of death and the 5th ranked cause of death is more than 5 times the amount.

*My question was: What is the leading cause of death in the world? To answer this, I first graphed all the diseases, all the years, across all the countries at once on a heatmap. After doing that, I was able to see that the Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and Neoplasms were the most common causes of death regardless of the year or place. 

*I wanted to take a closer look at the cardiovascular numbers and unpack what continents were causing such high numbers. I found and merged a continents csv file with the original dataframe. I split the world into continents and graphed each continent's CVD number of deaths across the years. Working with the raw numbers, I found that Asia by far had the highest number of CVD cases compared to any another continent, across all 30 years. It also showed that those cases were increasing as time went on. 

*Since Asia's population accounts for almost 60% of the world's population, the previous described graph isn't surprising. Further, the increased rate can be explained by the increasing total world population. But do these trends stay the same when we adjust for each continents population? My next question was: When we adjust for population, which continent have the highest number of CVD causes compared to other causes of death? We merged another CSV file that accounted for each country's population, and then created a new col for those respective percentages (number of deaths causes by CVD in country/total country population). We again re-plotted the graph to show that in fact Europe has the highest percentage of CVD disease cases by a landslide. 

*What does this mean? This means that although Asia has the highest population in the world, and therefore the highest number of CVD cases in the world, the percentage of CVD cases is the highest in Europe. 20% of the deaths in Europe were causes by CVD where as other continents only had 3-7%. 


**jared's section analysis**
Diseases such as neoplasms and cardiovascular disease have been steadily increasing amongst all populations of the world. The data shows a positive tendency that all continents have increasing death rates from these non-communicable diseases.

Despite these graphs showing raw values, we see a different story when the percentage of a continent’s population is taken into account.

As we can see, the visuals shows three separate world events that caused large increases in death. First, in 1994, on the blue line, representing the continent of Africa, the data illustrates the Rwandan Genocide with a death toll of nearly a million people. Secondly, in 2004, on the orange line representing the continent of Asia, we see a 9.1 magnitude earthquake near Sumatra, Indonesia that created a gigantic tsunami which caused a catastrophic event along the entire Indian Ocean region. Last, for the continent of North America, the data illustrates the sharp rise in 2010 due to the Haitian Earthquakes.

Asia has nearly 4 times the population of Africa, however Africa’s  raw total of causes of death by Communicable diseases nearly exceeds that of Asia. Diseases such as HIV/AIDS, neonatal and maternal disorders have disproportionately affected the continent of Africa while other continents have a slight negative trend. Although there is an overall negative trendline, this visual aid can show the necessity of healthcare in vulnerable populations such as Africa. 

**Josie's section analysis**

*My question was: what are the top reasons of death in Africa and how the reasons changed over 30 years? Why we choose to analyze Africa, it is because most of countries in Africa are developing countries and the death rate is quite high in Africa among the world.

After analyzing the dataset, the top 10 causes of death are shown in the chart and cardiovascular disease, HIV, diarrheal diseases, neonatal disorders and low respiratory infections are the top 5 reasons. We used these top five causes in the following analysis. Next, we'd like to know which countries have the most number of deaths and what are their main reasons of death in those countries. From the graph, we can see different countries have different health problems, for example, in south Africa, there is a high risk of HIV. Cardiovascular dieases is the leading cause of death in Egypt. 

Since our data include 30 years information, we also need to know what is the trend regarding the top five reasons over this long period, so that we can pay more attention to the increased ones. From the chart, we can see only cardiovascular increased and others decereased in recent years. The interesting part is the HIV trend increased first and then decreased after 2005. That is due to south Africa government’s obstruction of life-saving treatment and at least 35,000 babies were born with HIV infections that could have been prevented. Then from 2005 the international community started to focus on the HIV pandemic in South Africa and help them tackle the crisis. It is why HIV decreased in the following years.
